# Spam-Classification-using-NLP
This is a simple project where I have done spam classification using NLP and Naive Bayes Algorithm to predict whether the email is a spam or not.

Here I have used first removed the stopwords and the used BAG OF WORD as the encoding Technique to craete the document matrix.

After that I have splitted the data into train-test and fitted the model on Multinomial Naive Bayes.
